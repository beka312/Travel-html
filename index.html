                        Ala-Kul is a large alpine lake of glacial origin, located in the eastern part of the Terskey-Ala-Too
                        ridge on the southern shore of Lake Issyk-Kul, near the city of Karakol. The lake is located in a vast 
                        depression between the Karakol and Altyn-Arashan gorges and has no runoff. 
                        The name of the lake is translated from Kyrgyz as “variegated lake” and it is the best match for this place. 
                        Ala-Kul really amazes with its colors: bright turquoise water coexists with non-melting snow even in summer, 
                        green grass and mountain flowers of all kinds of shades.
